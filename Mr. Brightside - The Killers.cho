{sov: Verse 1}
[C]  Coming out of my [C/B]cage and I've been doing just [F]fine,
Gotta gotta be down, because I want it all.  [C]
It started out with a [C/B]kiss, how did it end up like [F]this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
{eov}

{sov: Verse 2}
[C]  Now I'm falling a-[C/B]sleep and she's calling a [F]cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking the [C]drag
[C]Now they're going to [C/B]bed and my stomach is [F]sick
And it's all in my head but she's touching his [Am]chest now
He takes off her [C]dress now
Let me [F]go
{eov}

{sov: Pre-chorus 1}
[Am]  I just can't look it's [C]killing me
And [F]taking control.
{eov}

{soc: Chorus}
[C]Jealousy, [Fsus2]turning saints in-[Am7]to the sea,
[G]Swimming through sick [C]lullabies,
[Fsus2]choking on your [Am7]alibis.
[G]But it's just the [C]price I pay,
[Fsus2]Destiny is [Am7]calling me,
[G]Open up my [C]eager eyes[Fsus2],______
[Am7]   â€˜Cause I'm Mr. Br[G]ightside
