# Music Sheets

This repo contains my chord / lead sheet arrangements, and config files for the applications that render them.

## ChordPro

The majority of these files are presented in ChordPro (.CHO) format. Although these are (for the most part) human-readable, they can be imported into a ChordPro app or editor to make them easier to read. Some examples:

- The official ChordPro application: <https://github.com/ChordPro/chordpro>

Various web-based editors:

- <http://ukegeeks.com/songeditor>
- <https://webchord.sourceforge.net>
- <https://www.chordpro.net/Chordpro>

Songbook-type apps:

- <https://songbook-pro.com/>
- <https://linkesoft.com/songbook/>
- <https://www.setlisthelper.com/>

The ChordPro specification adds new directives over time, and not all apps support them (for example, the `grid` directive).
