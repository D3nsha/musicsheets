{sov:Verse 1}
[Em]   Here I go ou-[D/F#]t to [G]sea again
The sunshine [D/F#]fills my [Em]hair,
And [D/F#]dreams hang in [G]the air     [D/F#]
[Em]   Gulls in the sky an[D/F#]d in [G]my blue eyes
You know it [D/F#]feels un[Em]fair
There's magic[D/F#] every[G]where.     [D/F#]

{soc: Chorus}
[Am]     No need to [Em]run, and hi[G]de

[Em]  And I need a friend, oh-[D/F#]oh I [G]need a friend
To make me [D/F#]happ[Em]y
Not [D/F#]stand here on my [G]own      [D/F#]
